# Combined Cycle Power Plant Full Load Electrical Power Output Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis and predictive modelling of the full load electrical power output a combined cycle power plant (CCPP) which is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another.

Computing the output of steam and gas power generation systems via thermodynamic analysis involves making many assumptions or solving thousands of nonlinear equations which requires an impractically large amount of computational effort and time. Machine learning can be an alternative approach to solving these kinds of problems. The machine learning approach approximates the performance of specific systems and configurations rather than solve the underlying thermodynamic equations to produce 'good-enough' answers for operational needs in a timely manner. This project aims to provide a simple and convenient predictive model to predict CCPP full load electrical power output without having to solve complex thermodynamic equations.

## Dataset Source
The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, at the URL:
[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/294/combined+cycle+power+plant](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/294/combined+cycle+power+plant.zip). A copy of the Excel file included in the Zip archive downloaded from the link is included in `data` directory in this repository.

## Data Description
The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant in Türkiye, over 6 years, from 2006 to 2011, when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly-averaged variables, AT (Ambient Temperature, °C), AP (Atmospheric Pressure, mbar), RH (Relative Humidity, %) and V (Exhaust Vacuum, cm Hg) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output PE(Full Load Electrical Power Output, MW) of the plant. Vacuum (V) measurements were made at the steam turbines. The other three variables, Ambient Temperature (AT), Atmospheric Pressure (AP) and Relative Humidity (RH), were collected at the gas turbines.

# Workflow Sequence and Code Walkthrough

The project workflow encompasses several stages, from data preparation to feature selection, to model training, and evaluation. Below is an outline of the sequence of activities.

### Data Ingestion

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**:
   - The raw dataset is loaded and preliminary checks for missing values and duplicates are conducted. Duplicates are removed to avoid data leakage.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

2. **Understanding Dataset Characteristics**:
   - Basic characteristics of the dataset, such as number of observations, number of variables, presence of missing values, etc is observed.
   - Sanity check on the value ranges is done to verify data quality.

3. **Investigating Correlations and Data Distribution**:
   - The correlation between feature-target pairs and feature-feature pair is looked into via a pair plot and a correlation matrix.
   - Histograms and boxplot are created to study the distribution od the data and check for presence of outliers.
   - Further investigation into outliers is done via scatterplot to see where they occur and how far they are from the rest of the data points and whether they are attached to or detached from them.

### Data Preparation

4. **Data Splitting**:
   - Data is split into training, validation, and test sets to ensure proper evaluation without data leakage.
   - The validation and test datasets are sized to contain over 1,000 rows each for robust testing.

5. **Preprocessing**:
   - A `StandardScalar` is used to scale all the features.
   - To address multicolinearity in the features, `PCA` is applied for the `SVR` pipeline but not required in `RandomForestRegressor` and `GradientBoostingRegressor`.

### Base Model Training and Tuning

7. **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Several machine learning algorithms are explored, including Support Vector, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Grid search with cross-validation is conducted to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for each model.

### Base Model Evaluation and Selection

8. **Evaluation**:
   - Models are tested on validation data using mean squared error as the performance metric.

9. **Compilation of Results**:
   - Model details such as tuned hyperparameters and performance metrics and the models themselves are stored into a dataframe, which is then sorted based on mean squared error to facilitate model selection.

10. **Model Selection**:
   - The dataframe row with the lowest mean squared error is selected and saved as a Pickle file for use later in training the final model.

### Model Finalization

11. **Final Model Training**:
   - The final model pipeline is created using the saved model as a template. Training is done using the combined training and validation datasets and evaluated on the test set to verify generalization and performance.

12. **Final Model Evaluation**:
   - The final model is then evaluated using the test dataset to verify performance and generalization.

13. **Model Serialization**:
   - It is serialized and saved in the `model` directory, ready for deployment in a production environment.

     ```
     kind create cluster
     ```
   - Check that the cluster is up by getting cluster info:
     ```
     kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind
     ```
   - Load the image into node:
     ```
     kind load docker-image ccpp:v001
     ```

10. **Create a Deployment**:

     pipenv shell
     ```
   - Run the direct prediction script:
     ```
     python3 predict_test_kube.py
     ```

The test script will send a prediction request to the service running in the Docker container in the deployment in the Kubernetes cluster. The output will display the details of the request, the prediction response, and a comparison with the actual value.

By following these steps, you should be able to replicate the project environment and run the model training and prediction service.

# Conclusion

This Combined Cycle Power Plant Full Load Electrical Power Output Prediction machine learning project aims to provide a simple and convenient predictive model to predict electrical power output without having to solve complex thermodynamic equations. The goal has been reached by training and serving a performant model.

The project underscores the usefulness of machine learning in power generation scenarios and the potential for predictive models to simplify and lower the computational cost of repetitive production planning and management in complex but specific and unchanging power generation scenarios. This is a good showcase of an alternative solution for computationally expensive or intractable problems that have to be solved repeatedly on a regular basis. However, depending on how they are set up, machine learning solutions may be limited to be sepcific scenarios or configurations and may not be generally applicable to variations of the same problem, as is the case here.

This project encapsulates the end-to-end process of a machine learning workflow, including data loading, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training and tuning, and deployment of a prediction service. By following the replication instructions, users can set up their environment, run the model training script, and deploy the resulting model as a prediction service to make power output predictions based on four measured values. The provided Dockerfile ensures that the prediction service is containerized, making the deployment consistent and scalable across different platforms.

This repository is structured to not only serve as a platform for CCPP electrical power output prediction but also as an educational resource for those looking to learn and apply machine learning operations (MLOps) practices. It demonstrates the use of various tools and technologies such as Jupyter notebooks for experimentation, Pipenv for environment management, Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for service serving.
